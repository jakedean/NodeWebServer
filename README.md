Hello!  This is my first shot at making node.js web framework.  I am trying to  make this into a general framework in which I will employ web services for the backend to deal with all of the data.  These web services will be an http call in which I can abstract the entire data retreival process away,  I want to experiment with streams and pipes and the whole time I am going to be trying to use as few libraries as possible in order to get a better understanding of the core node.js functionality.  

My personal website is currently a rails application right now, but in the process of making this framework I plan to shift my site over to node and get it deployed on Heroku.
